#The no nonsense GitHub Project. 
![alt tag](img/github_01.png) 
###A 1 hour no nonsense video tutorial series covering the basic usage of the worlds most popular version control software! 

Are you a self-taught Web or Software developer looking to take your first steps into the world of collaborative development? Or a coding bootcamp student looking to work on your first group project? Or perhaps you have simply never used GIT before and could use a crash course on how to use this software? If any of these apply to you, you've come to the right place.

I'm Michael Desantis! A Full-Stack web developer and Teachers Assistant at the Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin. In this video course I will be introducing the basics of .Git and GitHub (and no, they're not the same thing). I am creating this repository and README here to use as a handy reference guide to accompany the video material.

In this tutorial, you can watch and take notes. Or you can build a GitHub Repository of your own and follow along, pausing the videos as necessary. This course is structured in such a way where all the exercises build on the material from the previous videos. I highly recommend building a repository and following along step-by-step.  

The goal of this project is to provide you, the end user, with a brief, concise, and fast-paced instructional on how to use GIT. By the end of these videos, you should have a basic yet functional grasp and understanding of how to implement GIT in your development and projects.
